## Introduction
Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. By using a YAML file, we can configure our application's services. With a single command, we can create an dstart all the services from the configuration. Docker Compose can standalize the procedure of developpment. Giving a docker-compose.yml, we can get the same configuration. 

Using Compose can be concluded into three steps:
1. Define a Dockerfile. Dockerfile includes several commands and parameters. Based on a basic image, these commands create a new costomized image. With a Dockerfile, the app's environment can be reproduced anywhere.
2. Define a docker-compose.yml. docker-compose.yml integrates the seperate containers all together. A docker-compose.yml should include three main part: version, services and networks.
3. Run docker-compose up and Compose starts and runs entire app.


The form of Compose command is defined as follows:
> docker-compose [-f=<arg>...] [options] [COMMAND] [ARGS...]
    
There are four features of Compose that make it effective:
* Multiple isolated environments on a single host

Compose uses a single host to several isolated environments.

* Preserve volume data when containers are created

Compose preserve all the data when the volume is created. If it finds the container who has run before, it will copy the data from old container to new container so that the data won't lose.

* Only recreate containers that have changed

Compose only recreates the container who has changed its service. Because Compose caches the configuration. By re-using the existing containers, Compose becomes quicker.

* Variables and moving a composition between environments

Compose supports variables in the Compose file. These variables can be used to customize composition for different environments, or different users.


## Project 1
In this part, we use Docker-Compose to run `Frontend` and `Backend` in which `Frontend` is used to show the text we need to show and `Backend` is used to read the `input.txt` which can be changed by users. while initializing the image of frontend, it will start to listen the port of the backend with a js file. At backend side, a js file named `backend_servers.js` can read the text in `input.txt`. Finally, we can see this input at `localhost:8888`.
```
# This docker-compose file contains 3 parts: version, services and networks
version: '3'
services:
# Two services are used.  
  backend:
    build:
    # Build the image and container from the docker-file ./backend/Dockerfile
      context: ./backend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    image: backend # name the image
    container_name: backend # name the container
    networks:
    # Choose the network
      - frontbackend

  frontend:
    build:
    # Build the image and container from the docker-file ./frontend/Dockerfile
      context: ./frontend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    image: frontend # name the image
    container_name: frontend # name the container
    networks:
    # Choose the network
      - frontbackend
    ports:
    # Mapping the 8888 port of the container to the 8888 port of the host
      - "8888:8888"

networks:
  frontbackend:
```
### Result
1. Run docker-compose file to create two containers: `docker-compose up`

2. Verify the system by visiting the page: `localhost:8888`

3. Change the `input.txt` at the beckend and retest the system.

## Project 2

In this project, we use two containers. One is named as `mysql` which is use to read the database of mysql. The second is `python-server` which servers as the frontend. It gets the data from container `mysql` and puts on port 8888. For more details of the docker-compose file, please refer to the code and comments.

```
# This docker-compose file contains four parts: version, services, networks and volumes
version: '3'
services:
# Two services are used.  
  mysql:
    image: mysql:5.6 
	# Pull the sql image from the offical site, create the container based on this image.
    container_name: ct-mysql # define the container name
    networks:
	# Choose the network
      - net 
    volumes:
	# Attach the volume to container and specify the path of the volume in the container
      - vol_mysql:/var/lib/mysql
    environment:
	# Set the password
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=P@ssw0rd

  python-server:
    build: 
	# Build the image and container from the docker-file ./docker/Dockerfile
      context: ./docker
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    image: img-python-server:0.1 # Set image name
    container_name: ct-python-server # Set container name
    networks:
      - net
    ports:
	# Mapping the 8888 port of the container to the 8888 port of the host
      - "8888:8888"
    environment:
	# Set the host of this container
      - MYSQL_HOST=ct-mysql
networks:
# Create a defaut network name as 'net'
  net:
volumes:
# Create a defaut volume name as 'net'
  vol_mysql:
```

### Result
1. Run docker-compose file to create two containers: `docker-compose up`
![](11.png)
2. Initialize the database of mysql: `mysql -h CT_MYSQL_IP -u root -p < db1_tbl1.sql`
3. Verify the system: `curl localhost:8888`
